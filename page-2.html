<h1>MY PAGE 2</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Kronos Titan Anthem. I use Youtube, as you may know, and so on this page I will discuss my various
  different videos I've done. First, use this link to get to my YouTube channel. From there you can check out all my videos.

<h2>Sims 4</h2>
<p>Sims 4 is a life simulation game made by EA. I don't know why I like it but it is so fun for me.
  I used to just create sims and nothing else, but I've been getting into the actual game a bit more lately.
  However, currently the only posted videos are in create-a-sim as of April 11, 2020. Gameplay videos may be posted later.
</p>
<h3>Chow Family Create-a-Sim</h3>
<p>This was my first video ever, and it was a video of creating a 6 member household, the Chow family.
  I did not choose to name them Chow, I randomized the name. The only non-randomized name is Jared.
  Members: 1. Jared Chow, the dad. 2. Alayna Chow, the mom. 3. Gilbert Chow, the son. 4. Matilda Chow,
  the daughter. 5 and 6. Two dogs I don't remember the name of. The dogs are siblings.</p>
<div>More Descriptions Coming Soon</div>
<div>Check back on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuuRGu0rscHt0voYaRotLA>my channel</a> for more videos.
I don't upload very often, I'm sorry. I just don't have the time or energy to keep a regular upload schedule.
Please don't give up on my channel if there aren't any recent videos. Since there is no schedule, they could come any day.
Finally, I don't make promises on this channel, because I don't want to disappoint viewers. This means I do not:
1. Take requests. 2. Keep an upload schedule. 3. Have a guaranteed series on a schedule. (Minecraft Monday, Sims Sunday, Gacha Wednesday, etc.)
Hope you have fun on my channel! See you in my next video!</div>
