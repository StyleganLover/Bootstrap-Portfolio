<h1>MY PAGE 2</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Kronos Titan Anthem. I use Youtube, as you may know, and so on this page I will discuss my various
  different videos I've done. First, use this link to get to my YouTube channel. From there you can check out all my videos.

<h2>Sims 4</h2>
<p>Sims 4 is a life simulation game made by EA. I don't know why I like it but it is so fun for me.
  I used to just create sims and nothing else, but I've been getting into the actual game a bit more lately.
  However, currently the only posted videos are in create-a-sim as of April 11, 2020. Gameplay videos may be posted later.
</p>
<h3>Chow Family Create-a-Sim</h3>
<p>This was my first video ever, and it was a video of creating a 6 member household, the Chow family.
  I did not choose to name them Chow, I randomized the name. The only non-randomized name is Jared.
  Members: 1. Jared Chow, the dad. 2. Alayna Chow, the mom. 3. Gilbert Chow, the son. 4. Matilda Chow,
  the daughter. 5 and 6. Two dogs I don't remember the name of. The dogs are siblings.</p>
<h3>Skin Tones and Eye Colors Review</h3>
<p>To all my viewers, thank you. This video has received around 1,400 views. I can't get the exact number because
  YouTube shortened it, but this is definitely the highest viewed video on my channel. By contrast, my second-most
  viewed video has only 52 views. It seems that people are looking at custom content for answers on whether to buy it.
  It has also received 9 likes, which is also my most liked video. It is definitely possible that someone auto-refreshed and
  liked the video to cover up their tracks, but I certainly didn't and it doesn't seem like anyone else would do it
  because such a small channel probably won't be very profitable. Also, my goal isn't to be popular, it's to have fun and
  just have it be out there, but popularity is a possibility that I will definitely take. I love that my viewers 
  like my videos. Anyways sorry for the long speech but let's get into what this video is about. In this video, I reviewed some skin tones
  by Xmiramira, specifically the Melanin Pack 2, some rainbow skintones like purple and green from Noodles Sims 4, and the Little Sad Eyes
  from Wildly Miniature Sandwich.

<div>More Descriptions Coming Soon</div>
<div>Check back on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuuRGu0rscHt0voYaRotLA>my channel</a> for more videos.
I don't upload very often, I'm sorry. I just don't have the time or energy to keep a regular upload schedule.
Please don't give up on my channel if there aren't any recent videos. Since there is no schedule, they could come any day.
Finally, I don't make promises on this channel, because I don't want to disappoint viewers. This means I do not:
1. Take requests. 2. Keep an upload schedule. 3. Have a guaranteed series on a schedule. (Minecraft Monday, Sims Sunday, Gacha Wednesday, etc.)
Hope you have fun on my channel! See you in my next video!</div>
