    <h1>Sims 4 Packs I Think Would Be A Good Idea</h1>
    <h2>1. Sims 4: Genies</h2>
    <p>This pack idea does need a better name, but the concept would be the same. It would add in genies.
        In the FreeTime pack, Sims 2 had a genie, Midlock, but it wasn't playable. In the Sims 3 (I don't remember
        which pack) they had playable genies that you could even create from Create-a-sim. This pack in the Sims 4
        would focus around just genies, and would add many different create-a-sim items for genies to wear (of course
        normal Sims can wear them too). Some ideas:
        1. A genie world
        2. Premade genies and randomly generated genies
        3. Many different wishes
        4. Ability to wish for an object
        5. Create genies in Create-a-sim
        6. Become a genie with the Wish to be Genie interaction
        7. Multiple different genie lamps with different prices; higher priced ones will have more wishes
        8. Aspirations: (Good Genie, Evil Genie, Genie Family, etc.)
        9. Careers: (Paranormal, Genie Hunter)
        10. Traits: (Wishless, Wishful, Selfless Wisher)</p>
    <h2>2. Sims 4: Nerd Alert</h2>
    <p>I would consider myself a nerd as well as a geek. The two traits in the Sims 4, Genius and Geek, 
        don't cover it. Sims 4: Nerd Alert would add in stuff for both categories. A few ideas:
        1. Traits: (Mathematical, Quick Learner [as a trait separate from aspiration], Slow Learner)
        2. Objects: (Computers, Blackboards, Whiteboards)
        3. Aspirations (Mentor)
        4. A whole new part of personality, separate from traits and aspirations. It would be a ranking of 
        learning styles, Visual, Aural, Verbal, Physical, Logical, Social, and Solitary. (learning styles from https://www.learning-styles-online.com/overview/)
        It would determine how they build skills best, and also get Focused and Tense moodlets such as Using Preferred Learning Style
        and Not Learning Well.
        5. New video games and radio stations added
        6. New ways to build skills
        7. Interaction to Tinker on various appliances, electronic devices, and plumbing.
        Tinkering may lead to a discovery of an otherwise unusable upgrade. For example, when Tinkering on a shower,
        a Sim may upgrade the shower with Double Spray, or upgrade the stove with Food Never Spoils.
        8. When a Sim finds an upgrade through Tinkering, they may Share Tinkering Discoveries, and then the other Sim
        will be able to use the upgrade without Tinkering.</p>
